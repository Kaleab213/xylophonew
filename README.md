# xylophonew

A new Flutter project.

# My Goal  

In this project I havee dived into more Dart programming concepts and learned how to use open source Flutter packages. Now I am comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.

# What I have created 

I have made a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let us unleash our musical talent where ever we are.
